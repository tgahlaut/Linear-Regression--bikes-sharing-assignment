## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

- To improve the business of bike renting.
- bike sharing data has been used


## Conclusions
Temperature (temp) - A coefficient value of ‘0.5309’ indicated that a unit increase in temp variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.5309 units.
Year (yr) - A coefficient value of ‘0.2294’ indicated that a unit increase in yr variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.2294 units.
Weather Situation 3 (weathersit_3) - A coefficient value of ‘-0.2993’ indicated that, a unit increase in weathersit_3 variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.2993 units.

season_4: - A coefficient value of ‘0.1412’ indicated a unit increase in season_4 variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.1412 units.

windspeed: - A coefficient value of ‘-0.1169’ indicated that, a unit increase in windspeed variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.1169 units.
